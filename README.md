I'm currently a software engineer with [google.org](https://google.org) (pro bono), working on `${PROJECT}`. In my day job I'm an SRE with [google.com](https://google.org) (for profit).

How email maps to my activity:

1. `@gmail.com` - Personal projects.
2. `@google.com` - Work for, on-behalf-of, or as a member of Google.
