I'm currently a software engineer with [google.org](https://google.org) (pro bono), working on [mapping lead pipes](https://github.com/BlueConduit/open-data-platform). In my day job I'm an SRE with [google.com](https://google.com) (for profit).

Personal projects I'm proud of are now part of [RecSoft](https://github.com/rec-soft). Email me if you'd like to collaborate!

How email maps to my activity:

1. `@gmail.com` - Personal projects (pre-Google or IARC-approved).
2. `@google.com` - Work for, on-behalf-of, or as a member of Google.
